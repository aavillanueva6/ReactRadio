      "Dee Alexander is one of Chicago's most gifted and respected vocalists/songwriters. Her musical interests span virtually every genre, especially those related to the African diaspora, including Gospel, R&B, Blues, Neo-soul and other musical forms. Her true heart and soul though, are ultimately expressed in their purest form through her explorations in Jazz, the one idiom that can encompass all her interests and influences. Ms. Alexander gravitated toward this musical form at an early age. She names Sarah Vaughan, Billie Holiday, Nina Simone and Ella Fitzgerald among her many major influences. Chicago saxophonist “Light” Henry Huff, as well, profoundly influenced her by encouraging the taking of risks and the crossing of boundaries, setting her on a path to emerge as one of the most celebrated vocal improvisers on the scene today. From a sultry traditional ballad to a contemporary jazz-funk groove, a high-flying swing, or scat-filled romp, Alexander delivers each style with a passion and love of music that comes across in each and every note, and with a style and grace that is truly her own."

His broadcast career started at Fisk University in Nashville, Tennessee, where he was instrumental in putting their Jazz-formatted radio station on the air. Afterward he served Detroit's WJZZ as a staff announcer and Music Director for nearly a decade. John's next opportunity brought him back home to Chicago, programming the popular Jazz and Gospel-formatted WBEE radio in suburban Harvey, serving Chicago's south side. Also broadcasting at Northern Illinois University's News and Blues-formatted WNIJ, John feels extremely fortunate to reprise the relationship with Jazz he describes as a calling. “Ever since, out of sheer curiosity, I bought an Ahmad Jamal LP from a neighborhood grocery store rack and discovered Jazz art, or maybe it was first hearing Nancy Wilson during one of [legendary Chicago Jazz radio announcer] Daddy-O Daylie's shows... when the opportunity came to play this great music on the radio, it was really like the fulfillment of a dream. So now, joining the WFMT Jazz Network is both a privilege and a real pleasure,” he said."

That is the mission of WDCB's radio program New Vintage, hosted by Bill O'Connell. Bill got turned on to the big band sounds in 1974 when he saw Maynard Ferguson perform at Gordon Tech High School in Chicago. After establishing himself as a professional educator at Triton College in River Grove, IL, Bill grew tired of playing wedding music and formed his own big band in 1988. Early on, Bill's big band received calls primarily from dance clubs. Though it was steady work, Bill knew that his calling was playing modern big band arrangements. Celebrate America's greatest contribution to world music history. You can catch Bill every Sunday at 6pm. Jazz. Ever innovative, always changing.",

In addition to music, travel is one of his main interests and that has taken him to all 50 U.S. states, Europe and Peru. Along with taking in the history of these places, Dave has always made a point to seek out their musical culture as well, something that never fails to enhance a journey anywhere in the world."
